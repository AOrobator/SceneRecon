Research Log==========This is a log of all my findings and processes while making this project.## 2.07.2014For my first step, I want to figure which sensors I should use on the device tocheck the device orientation, for taking pictures. I want to do this so that Ican make sure that the user is taking upright pictures every time. Upon lookingat the different types of [sensors that are available on theAndroid platform](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview.html),there are a few that stood out for me and might be of use:* [TYPE_ORIENTATION](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html#TYPE_ORIENTATION): Measures degrees of rotation that a device makes around allthree physical axes (x, y, z). As of API level 3 you can obtain the inclinationmatrix and rotation matrix for a device by using the gravity sensor and thegeomagnetic field sensor in conjunction with the getRotationMatrix() method.* [TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html#TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR): Measures the orientation of a device by providing thethree elements of the device's rotation vector.In the documentation, it says that TYPE_ORIENTATION can be used for determiningdevice position while TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR is used for motion detection androtation detection.Below are the available sensors on my testing device, an HTC One. Both sensorsthat I'm interested in are present.* 3-axis Magnetic field sensor* 3-axis Accelerometer* Proximity sensor* Light sensor* Gyroscope sensor* **Orientation sensor*** **Rotation vector*** Linear acceleration* Gravity* Gesture sensor### The coordinate system for the world![The coordinate system for the world](http://developer.android.com/images/axis_globe_inverted.png)Based on the [documentation](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_position.html),for now it seems that I should use the orientation sensor. It provides the followingdata via [`getOrientation`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html#getOrientation(float[], float[])). All units are in radians:* SensorEvent.values[0] : Azimuth (angle around the z-axis)* SensorEvent.values[1] : Pitch (angle around the x-axis)* SensorEvent.values[2] : Roll (angle around the y-axis)
